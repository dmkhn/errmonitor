errmonitor
==========

Code location: https://github.com/v1nx/errmonitor
Tested on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS with a custom 3.8.0-rc7 kernel image.

Short description
=================

There's server side - error report monitor (monitor.c) and error report generator - errgen.c
Both are configurable through a set of command line options, short help for command line options is also available though '--help'.

Clients are handled through a special list which stores information about error occurence for particular client.
Clients are identified by unique ID.
Server creates two ZMQ sockets - one for publishing control commands to client and another for pulling error reports from client.
Error report processing is happenning in the main thread.
When a report from a new client is received a new entry containing client info is created and added to the clients list.
Also a separate thread is created which is in charge of checking whether corrective action has to be performed.

Client uses two ZMQ sockets - one is used for subscribing to control events from the server, another is used for pushing reports to server.
Error report generation is happennig in the main thread, handling of control events is happening in a separate thread.

Unit test
=========

Run ./test.sh - /var/log/syslog messages will be shown in the terminal
Run ./kill.sh to terminate all instances of monitor/errgen
